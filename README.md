# BacklightTooler
Simple C utility to tool your backlight

# How to use
Simply compile with gcc main.c -o BacklightTooler. Then you can run it with ./BacklightTooler inc or dec to increment or decrement the backlight.

I'd recommend to run it as setuid for ease of use so you can bind it to a key combination.
